# Rob Ford

Mayor of Toronto. Subway advocate. Shitty driver. Dickhead.

There are a lot of tweets about Rob Ford. Not a lot of them are complimentary. But now they're all available in [one place](http://robfordmayor.ca).

## How to contribute

Just fork this repository and send me a pull request. I use a [Serve](https://github.com/jlong/serve) application (found in [`src`](https://github.com/iamsolarpowered/rob_ford/tree/master/src)) plus a custom [`Rakefile`](https://github.com/iamsolarpowered/rob_ford/blob/master/Rakefile) to generate the site.

If you edit the Serve app, simply run

    $ rake

in the root directory to re-compile everything.

If you want to edit the compiled HTML/JS/CSS, feel free. I'll transpose the changes.
