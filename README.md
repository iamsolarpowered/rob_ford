# Rob Ford

Mayor of Toronto. Subway advocate. Shitty driver. Dickhead.

There are a lot of tweets about Rob Ford. Not a lot of them are complimentary. But now they're all available in (one place)[http://iamsolarpowered.github.com/rob_ford].

## How to contribute

Just for this repository and send me a pull request. I use a (Serve)[https://github.com/jlong/serve] application (found in (`src`)[tree/master/src]) plus a custom (`Rakefile`)[blob/master/Rakefile] to generate the site.

If you edit the Serve app, simply run
    $ rake
in the root directory to re-compile everything.

If you want to edit the compiled HTML/JS/CSS, feel free. I'll transpose the changes.
